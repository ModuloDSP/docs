Modulo is an interactive platform for signal processing and control, enabling digital filter design, system simulation, and spectral analysis. Users can visualize filter responses, generate coefficients, and explore signal transformations in real time.

Please refer to the [https://github.com/ModuloDSP/webapp](project's README) for info on setting up and using the software.
This repo is intended to provide more details info on the usage of the software as well as the math that goes behind them.
